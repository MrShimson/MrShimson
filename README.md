### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Semyon - developer-beginner from Moscow.

I'm currently learning PHP and its framework Larvel, trying to become a professional **PHP Developer**.
I've made some educational PHP projects, while learning in online programming school [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/), you can watch it in my profile.

I spend a lot of time, trying to improve my qualification by:
* reading differnt articles and professional literature, like:
  * "PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice" by Matt Zandstra (in process)
  * "Clean Code" by Robert Martin (in process)
  * "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava (finished)
* watching professsional lectures and educational videos (recently started watching Harvard's CS50 course)
* always trying to consolidate achived knowledge by solving different tasks (at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) as example) and more

I've made a long way, trying to find my calling, and finally decided, that I want to be a **Web-developer**.

Here are some reasons that influenced my decision:
* It constantly evolving, so it allows you to learn something new permanently (i like it the most :D)
* The more you learn, the more creatively you can solve different problems
* You can't always be satisfied at 100% about your code, decisions that you've made in developing process,
so there is always an opportunity to upgrade your solution, making it better and better
